# Data organization

## TIF files

The ImageXpress by Molecular Devices has an opinionated data structure, and wrmXpress assumes this structure.

Each experiment should include a root directory with the plate name formated as `YYYYMMDD-p##-XYZ` where `p##` is a plate number and `XYZ` are the investigator's initials. The plate name may also include a random integer/index appended in the format `_###`.

Inside of this plate directory should be separate directories for each time point formated as `TimePoint_#` and starting with `TimePoint_1`. If no additional time points were included in the experiment, then the only folder inside of the root directory should be `TimePoint_1`.

Time point folders will contain the raw images in `.TIF` format. Each image should be named `{plate name}_{well}.TIF`. If there was an index appended to the plate name, this should not be included in the image names. In the case of experiments with multiple
wavelengths per well, `_w#` should be appended after the well ID.

Example of these data structures are shown below:

</p>

*Note that a `.HTD` files are included in these structure, which is generated by the ImageXpress but not necessary for wrmXpress usage.*

## AVI files

Some pipelines (i.e., motility, tracking) accept AVI video files instead TIF files within time point folders. In this case, the root plate folder should contain the AVI files in the format `{plate name}_{well}.AVI`, as below:

 <img src="../img/avi_structure.png" width="40%" hspace="10" align="top-left"/>

In this case, the AVI file structure needs to be selected in Configure. During analysis, the files may be rearranged to include the time point/TIF structure described above. If so, it is recommended that subsequent analyses should  maintain the reorganized structure and select the ImageXpress file structure.
