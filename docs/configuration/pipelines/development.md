# Development

***Detailed experimental protocols for preparing and imaging Caenorhabditis elegans phenotypes can be found at the following link:***

- [Protocol for *Caenorhabditis elegans* image-based screening](https://protocolexchange.researchsquare.com/article/pex-2018/v1)

## Expected input

Development data may be analyzed in the form of individual TIF images per frame (i.e., the TimePoint structure utilized by ImageXpress). See the [Data Organization](../data_organization.md) page for more details. The plate directory should have a single TimePoint with individual images for each well:

All experiments should include a single wavelength. Multisite images should be stitched according the [ImageXpress + Multi Site instructions](../../instrument_settings/#imagexpress-multi-site).

### Validated species and stages

#### *Caenorhabditis elegans*

- Larvae
- Young adults
- Gravid adults
- Mixed stages

### Example plates

- 20220408-p01-MGC_1351: *Caenorhabditis elegans* mixed stages

## Expected output

A CSV file with at many columns of data generated by with [CellProfiler's](https://cellprofiler.org/) [Worm Toolbox](https://cellprofiler.org/wormtoolbox). If using [Metadata](), there will be an additional column for each provided metadata data frame.
